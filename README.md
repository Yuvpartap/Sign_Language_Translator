• Developed a Deep learning model (LSTM) using Python that recognizes human hand signs using computer vision tools (OpenCV) and translates the sign language into readable sentences in the form of captions.
• Achieved an accuracy of 92 % in recognizing the hand signs and interpreting the correct meaning.
• Tech Stack: Deep Learning (CNN and LSTM), Python, OpenCV
